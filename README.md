# VisualizingAlgorithms-
Using openGL and GLUT created a visualization of 3 alogrithms (Insertion, Bubble, Selection). After each algorithm is ran you can populate it with random integers by right clicking on the window. 

The amount of random integers is hard coded. Also the delay (in milliseconds) has been hard coded.
